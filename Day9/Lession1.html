    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "The Anthologist," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's â€œNew and Selected Poems, Volume One."

For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."</p>

        into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
        how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
        which is what I have been doing all day.
